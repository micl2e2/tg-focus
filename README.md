# About

tg-focus is a comprehensive **T**ele**g**ram message filter that helps
you **focus**. A gentle User Bot for message forwarding.

Several forms of text messages are supported:

1. Chat Message(Raw/Reply/Forward/Quoted)
2. Media Caption
3. Emoji
4. Channel Update

By customizing *Focus Filters*, tg-focus can forward any specific
message from any chat to a dedicated chat named *TG-FOCUS*, that way
users have full control of the messages they see.

Telegram is famous for its openness. While users are free to make a
speech in any public chat, they should be equally free to choose what
they see. Telegram's official client apps already have excellent
support for the former need, tg-focus and other counterparts are
trying to fill the blank in the latter one. 

Notable features:

-   **Reliable & Consistent**: Built directly on top of official
    C++ interfaces([TDLib](https://core.telegram.org/tdlib/)). All
    communications towards Telegram servers are completely handled by
    TDLib.

-   **Easy to customize**: Users can customize *Focus Filter* any
    time they like. The filter accepts both simple text and [regular 
    expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression). The
    configuration file is in human-readable 
    [TOML](https://toml.io/en/) format.

-   **Ready to deploy**: Releases are made in three forms: source,
    Docker image and prebuilt binary.

# A Simple Demo

Below is a simple 9-step demonstration of a common use case:
forwarding the messages that contains the keywords we want, ignoring
the message that sent from the users we don't want.

# How To Use

Before anything make sure you have:

1. A Telegram account
2. A Telegram API ID and the corresponding API HASH, they can be
   obtained at https://my.telegram.org. 

There are two different ways to deploy tg-focus, through [Docker Image](#docker-imagerecommended),
or [Executable Binary](#executable-binary):

### Docker Image(Recommended)

Make sure have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/) or
[Podman](https://podman.io/) installed on your machine:

**Step 1:**

Pull the image and run it in the background, assuming the newly
created container's name is CONTAINER-NAME: 

```sh
docker pull micl2e2/tg-focus
docker run -d micl2e2/tg-focus
```

**Step 2:**

Login your Telegram account first, it needs API ID, API HASH,
your phone number (in international format, e.g., `+1234567` if your phone number is `234567` with country code `+1`) 
and a login code, the first two can be obtained in https://my.telegram.org:

```sh
docker exec -it CONTAINER-NAME tgf-conf auth
```
If you've logged in successfully, the last three lines will be:
```
[tgf INFO] Log in successfully!
[tgf INFO] Closing...
[tgf INFO] Closed
```

**Step 3: (Optional)**

Using different language other than default(English) by:

```sh
docker exec -it CONTAINER-NAME tgf-conf lang XX-YY
```
Note: XX is the language code, YY is the region code, e.g. "en-US" represents
"English (United States)", "en-GB" represents "English (United Kingdom)", etc. 
All valid codes can be found at 
http://www.lingoes.net/en/translator/langcode.htm 

**Step 4:**

If logined successfullly, a new chat *TG-FOCUS* will be
created, the subsequent messages will be filtered and forwarded to
that chat.

**Step 5:**

Note that by default, tg-focus will forward **all** messages
you receive. You can change the *Focus Filter*s(the filter
configuration) any time you like, to custom the messages you'd like
to receive on that chat. See [examples](#filter-examples).

```sh
docker exec -it CONTAINER-NAME tgf-conf filters
```

(NOTE: This will open the embeded [GNU
nano](https://www.nano-editor.org/) editor for configuration
modification. After modification, press **Ctrl-O**, **Enter**, **Ctrl-X**
to finish the work. If the modified one is valid, the last line of
output shall be "Saving filters...")

**Step 6:**

Done.

**Step 7: (Optional)**

Use following command if you want to destroy the
instance and its Telegram-related credentials and resource:

```sh
docker rm --force CONTAINER-NAME
```

### Executable Binary

**Step 1:**

Download the binaries at GitHub releases
[page](https://github.com/micl2e2/tg-focus/releases). Please check
whether your [platform](#supported-platforms) is supported or not.

**Step 2:**

Login your Telegram account first, it needs API ID, API HASH,
your phone number (in international format, e.g., `+1234567` if your phone number is `234567` with country code `+1`) 
and a login code, the first two can be obtained in https://my.telegram.org:

```sh
/path/to/tgf-conf auth
```
If you've logged in successfully, the last three lines will be:
```
[tgf INFO] Log in successfully!
[tgf INFO] Closing...
[tgf INFO] Closed
```

**Step 3: (Optional)**

 Using different language other than default(English) by:

```sh
/path/to/tgf-conf lang XX-YY
```
Note: XX is the language code, YY is the region code, e.g. "en-US" represents
"English (United States)", "en-GB" represents "English (United Kingdom)", etc. 
All valid codes can be found at 
http://www.lingoes.net/en/translator/langcode.htm 

**Step 4:**

Launch tg-focus daemon:

```sh
# run in foreground
/path/to/tgf-focusd

# or run in background
nohup /path/to/tgf-focusd &
```

**Step 5:**

If logined successfullly, a new chat `TG-FOCUS` will be
created, the subsequent messages will be filtered and forwarded to
that chat.

**Step 6:**

Note that by default, tg-focus will forward **all** messages
you receive. You can change the *Focus Filter*s(the filter
configuration) any time you like, to custom the messages you'd like
to receive on that chat. See [examples](#filter-examples).

```sh
/path/to/tgf-conf filters
```

(NOTE: This will open the [GNU nano](https://www.nano-editor.org/)
editor for configuration modification. After modification, press
**Ctrl-O**, **Enter**, **Ctrl-X** to finish the work. As long as the
configuration is valid, the last line of output shall be "Saving
filters...") 

**Step 7:**

Done.


# Filtering Rules

A *Focus Filter* is a filter used by tg-focus to match against the
message's text content(text, emoji, or media caption). They are:
- `title`
- `keywords`
- `no-keywords`
- `senders`
- `no-senders`
- `rej-senders`

Users can add as many filters as they like, they accept **simple
text** or **regular expression**. 

When a message comes, they are tried one by one, if there is any
filter than can *match* the message and not *skip* the message , it
will be forwarded.

Currently *Focus Filter* can *match*:

- Chat title(`title`)
- Keywords(`keywords`)
- Senders(`senders`)

can *skip*:

- Keywords(`no-keywords`)
- Senders(`no-senders`)

can *reject*:

- Senders(`rej-senders`)

A message is forwarded **if and only if**:

- it is *matched* by a *Focus Filter*, **and**
- it is *not skipped* by that *Focus Filter*, **and**
- it is *not rejected* by any previous *Focus Filter*.

(Note that the first three rules can be regarded as **whitelist**,
the second two rules can be regarded as **weak blacklist**, the third
one can be regarded as **strong blacklist**) 


## Filter Examples

Say we want to forward all messages in a chat named
"👍AnAwesomeChat👍": 

works, the chat title is fully matched: 

```toml
[[focus-filter]]
title = "👍AnAwesomeChat👍"
```

works, the chat title is partly matched:

```toml
[[focus-filter]]
title = "AnAwesomeChat"
```

works, the chat title is partly matched: 

```toml
[[focus-filter]]
title = "Awesome"
```

works, the chat title is partly matched:

```toml
[[focus-filter]]
title = "👍"
```

works, the regular expression matches the chat title:

```toml
[[focus-filter]]
title = ".*Awesome.*"
```

Say we want to forward the messages that contain "football", but not
"basketball", from a chat named "Sports User Group". We can write our filters as

```toml
[[focus-filter]]
title = "Sports User Group"
keywords = ["football", "soccer"]
no-keywords = ["basketball"]
```

Say we want the messages containing "football", or any other
messages except the ones containing "basketball", and the ones sent by
the user whose full name is "Basketball Lover", or the ones sent by the
user whose user ID is "alice_love_basketball", from a chat named
"SportsUserGroup". We can write the filter as:

```toml
# 1st
[[focus-filter]]
title = "Sports User Group"
keywords = ["football", "soccer"]

# 2nd
[[focus-filter]]
title = "Sports User Group"
no-keywords = ["basketball"]
no-senders = ["Basketball Love", "@alice_love_basketball"]
```

So these message will be forwarded:

- `Alice: I love football!` (matching the 1st)
- `Bob: I play soccer.` (matching the 1st)
- `Alice: I am good at swimming.` (matching the 2nd)
- `Bob: Sometime I also play badminton.` (matching the 2nd)
- `Alice: I play football and basketball.` (matching the 1st, skip the 2nd)

these will NOT be forwarded:

- `Alice: I play badminton and basketball.` (matching the 2nd's
  "no-keywords" means a *reject*)
- `Basketball Lover: Hellop everyone!` (a *reject* by the 2nd)
- `Alice @alice_love_basketball: Hi, I am Alice, I love sports.`
  (a *reject* by the 2nd)


# Troubleshooting

## My TG-FOCUS stops formarding message

Try to restart `tgf-focusd` program or container.


# Q & A

## Can I trust tg-focus?

Absolutely yes!

First of all, consider that tg-focus is a GPL-licensed [free
software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html). 

tg-focus inherits the openness of TDLib, its source as well as its 
dependencies' source are completely open. Additionally, all its
binaries and OCI images will **not** be built by any individual, but
by Github-hosted machines. All build details can be found in a
dedicated repository
[tg-focus-cicd](https://github.com/micl2e2/tg-focus-cicd). 

Telegram bot is useful for some specific tasks, but not sufficient
to be a **comprehensive** message filter. Therefore, during the
authorization process, tg-focus needs to log in user's account,
which in turn needs a phone number and login code,
just as any functional Telegram client would require. It only saves
API ID/HASH on the user's machine because these two are
required each time client initialization. But **under no
circumstances** would tg-focus save user's phone number or any
other credentials.


## What makes tg-focus a gentle User Bot?

TDLib states that it is _a library for building Telegram
clients_. By embedding TDLib, tg-focus, like any other User
Bot, is able to use all TDLib's public APIs. While it opens the
possibility for many powerful features, it also means User Bots have
far more privileges than a general-purpose
[Bot](https://core.telegram.org/bots). This can be a double-edged
sword.

There are already some examples where some of the good-purpose User
Bots disappoint their users because of their misuse of Telegram APIs,
such as repeatedly sending random messages to users' random
chats, or other unmanaged behaviors. This is probably one of
the reasons why Telegram User Bots have a bad reputation. 

However, tg-focus will not follow their paths, we have one strict
principle: **all message collected by tg-focus will only be forwarded
to a newly created chat**. 

With this principle, it is firmly guaranteed that **no** messages
generated by tg-focus will be ever sent to the wrong chat. Additionally,
there is **no** reason for tg-focus users to worry about whether any
existing or new features will be harmful or not. By the time of
updates, tg-focus will remain **gentle**.
