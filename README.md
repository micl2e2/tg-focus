tg-focus is a comprehensive Telegram message filter that helps
you **focus**. A gentle user bot for message forwarding. Most of
message types are supported: public/private chats, channel updates,
and more.

By customizing *filters* through TGFCMD, tg-focus can forward any specific
message from any chat to a dedicated chat, **TG-FOCUS**, that way
you have full control of the messages you see.

tg-focus is built on top of [TDLib](https://core.telegram.org/tdlib/) directly, in which way tg-focus is
inherently as consistent, reliable and stable as TDLib itself for most
Telegram-specific features.

The supported platforms are:

# Quickstart

The following 6 steps will help you start up tg-focus and filter some
specific messages.

1.  Download the binaries at GitHub releases [page](https://github.com/micl2e2/tg-focus/releases).

2.  Extract the files:
    
        # linux 
        tar xf tg-focus-3.0-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
        cd tg-focus-3.0-linux-x86_64

3.  Log in your Telegram account firstly, it needs your phone number
    and a login code. Phone number should be typed in international
    format, e.g., `+1 23 4567` if your phone number is `23 4567` with
    region code `+1` (spaces are allowed). 
    
        ./tgfocus auth
        
        # enter your phone and login code...
    
    If everthing works fine, you should see:
    
        Logged in successfullly!

4.  Start up tg-focus daemon:
    
        ./tgfocus quickstart
    
    If everthing works fine, you should see:
    
        startup: done
        focus-start: done

5.  Go back to your Telgram application, wait for the TG-FOCUS
    group showing up. 
    
    **If** TG-FOCUS chat does not appear, you can send a message
    "tg-focus" in a random group(e.g. Saved Messages) to get it shown
    up. This is because by default, only messages contain "tg-focus"
    will be filtered and forwarded.

6.  Once the chat shown up, you send a message `TGFCMD help` to get
    started. The following image tutorials will show you how to use it.

7.  Image Tutorials: Say there is a Telegram user, called Bob. He owns
    a group. Every day, plenty of messages are sending out in that
    group, it is too overwhelming, Bob wants to focus on the
    messages that strongly interest him, he decides to use
    tg-focus. After the previous 6-step setup, he now is going to use
    TGFCMD to configure his tg-focus to forward the messages he is
    strongly interested in:

# TGFCMD Examples

*Note that TGFCMD commands are to be sent out in the TG-FOCUS group*

To forward the messages that belong to the chat "Freedom User Group":

    TGFCMD filter.edit 1 titles add "Freedom User Group"

To forward the messages that sent by the user "Some One":

    TGFCMD filter.edit 1 senders add "Some One"

To forward the messages that contain a word "freedom":

    TGFCMD filter.edit 1 keywords add "freedom"  

To forward two types of messages, the first contains a word "free
things" and belongs to the chat "Nonfree Lovers", the second contains
a word "nonfree things" and belongs to "Free Lovers":

    TGFCMD filter.edit 1 titles add "Nonfree Lovers"
    TGFCMD filter.edit 1 keywords add "free things"
    TGFCMD filter.edit 2 titles add "Free Lovers"
    TGFCMD filter.edit 2 keywords add "nonfree things"

Not to forward the messages that sent by the user "Nonfree Lover":

    TGFCMD filter.edit 1 no-senders add "Nonfree Lover"

Check current filters configuration:

    TGFCMD filters

Pause forwarding:

    TGFCMD pause

Resume forwarding:

    TGFCMD resume

# Filters Rules

Filters configurationa is composed of many *Focus Filters*. A *Focus
Filter* is a filter to match against the message's 
chat/sender/content. They have several rules(or properties):

-   *titles*
-   *keywords*
-   *senders*
-   *no-titles*
-   *no-senders*
-   *no-keywords*

Simply put, *titles*, *keywords*, *senders* are the lists of
chat titles, keywords, senders that you are interested in respectively.
*no-titles*, *no-keywords*, *no-senders* are the ones you don't want
to see.

Users can add values to those rules as many as they like, they
accept ****simple text**** or ****regular expression****, as well as filters.

When a message comes, filters are tried one by one, if there is any
filter than can **match** the message and not **reject** it, it
will be forwarded to TG-FOCUS chat. 

A focus filter **matches** the message if it matches any filter's:

-   *titles* and
-   *senders* and
-   *keywords*

Note that an empty rule(i.e., you haven't configure it) matches
everthing.

If a focus filter  fails to match the incoming message, the next focus
filter will be tried. If all focus filters fail to match it, the
message will be discarded.

A focus filter **rejects** the message if it matches any filter's:

-   *no-title* or
-   *no senders* or
-   *no-keywords*

Note thta if any focus filter rejects the message, the next focus
filter will not be tried, and the message will be discarded.

(You can think of the first three rules as *whitelist*,
the last three rules as *blacklist*)

## Development


### Linux

        considered an issue if not working there.*

Software:

-   bash, git, sudo, apt, etc.
    -   run `bash ci/prep-libs-deb11-x86_64.bash` to automatically
        prepare them.
-   custom built GCC
    -   run `bash ci/prep-toolc-deb11-x86_64.bash` to automatically
        prepare them.

Building:

-   run `bash ci/build-tgfocus-deb11-x86_64.bash` to get a Release
    build.
-   run `DDD=1 bash ci/build-tgfocus-deb11-x86_64.bash` to get a Debug
    build.

# FAQ


## Why yet another Telegram message forwarder?

There are already many TG message forwarders over there, and some of
them have been continously developed for a long time. I do think most
of them are doing a great job. But however what I was looking for is a
message forwarder with the combination of stability, reliability and
transparency, none of them could completely meet my personal
preference, at least in the days before this project started.


## Can I trust tg-focus?

Yes.

First of all, consider that tg-focus is a GPL-licensed [free
software](<https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html>). As for
privacy, only credentials necessary for tdlib initialization are saved
on the user's machine. And they are completely *yours-irrelavent*. As
for source code, tg-focus's source as well as its dependencies' source
are completely open.

And one more step we take is that, all of released binaries are built
by **not** any individual, but **Github-hosted** machines.
Check [github actions](https://github.com/micl2e2/tg-focus/actions) for more details.
