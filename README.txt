  tg-focus is a reliable <b>T</b>ele<b>g</b>ram message filter/forwarder
  that helps you *focus*. A gentle user bot for message forwarding. Most
  of message types are supported: public/private chats, channel updates,
  and more.

  With [TGFCMD], you have full control of the messages you'd see in a
  dedicated chat *TG-FOCUS*.

  Being built on top of [TDLib] directly, tg-focus is inherently as
  consistent, reliable and stable as TDLib itself for most
  Telegram-specific features.

  The supported platforms are:

Overhead
────────

  In case someone cares about the overhead, here is a rough overview,
  randomly captured after *~2 months* of uninterrupted running on a *1C
  1G* machine: With *~500K* messages being filtered, it occupied *<1%*
  of CPU and *<40%* of memory (TDLib included).


Quickstart
══════════

  You can use [Docker] or [executable binaries] to get started.


[Docker] See section Using Docker/Podman

[executable binaries] See section Using Binaries

Using Docker/Podman
───────────────────

  The following 5 steps will help you run tg-focus and filter some
  specific messages.

  1. Download the images:

     ┌────
     │ docker pull micl2e2/tg-focus
     └────
     or
     ┌────
     │ # if you use Podman rather than Docker
     │ podman pull docker.io/micl2e2/tg-focus
     │ 
     │ # If you have trouble in reaching Docker Hub, try GitHub Package:
     │ docker pull ghcr.io/micl2e2/tg-focus
     │ # or
     │ podman pull ghcr.io/micl2e2/tg-focus
     └────

  2. Run tg-focus:

     ┌────
     │ docker run -d --name tgfocus micl2e2/tg-focus     
     └────

  3. Log in your Telegram account:

     ┌────
     │ docker exec -i tgfocus auth
     │ 
     │ # Enter phone number: +1 23 4567
     │ # Enter login code: xxxxxx
     └────

     /note: phone number in international format `+1 23 4567' if your
     number is `23 4567' with region code `+1' (spaces are allowed)./

     If everthing works fine, you should see:

           Logged in!

     You can check more details about tg-focus by `docker exec -i
     tgfocus status'.

  4. Go back to your Telgram application, wait for the TG-FOCUS group
     showing up. /(usually takes up 1~2 mins, depends on your network
     connection)/

           If TG-FOCUS group doesn't appear, send a message
           "tg-focus" in a random group(e.g. Saved
           Messages). /This is because by default, only messages
           contain "tg-focus" will be filtered and forwarded./

           If TG-FOCUS group doesn't appear after a long
           wait(e.g. 10 mins), run a command `./tgfocus status',
           report and open a GitHub issue with the command output
           attached.

  5. Once the group shown up, you send a message `TGFCMD help' to get
     started. Check [TGFCMD] for more details.


[TGFCMD] See section Using TGFCMD


Using Binaries
──────────────

  The following 6 steps will help you run tg-focus and filter some
  specific messages.

  1. Download the binaries at GitHub releases [page].

  2. Extract the files:

     ┌────
     │ # linux 
     │ tar xf tg-focus-3.0-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
     │ cd tg-focus-3.0-linux-x86_64
     └────

  3. Log in your Telegram account:

     ┌────
     │ ./tgfocus auth
     │ 
     │ # Enter phone number: +1 23 4567
     │ # Enter login code: xxxxxx
     └────

     /note: phone number in international format `+1 23 4567' if your
     number is `23 4567' with region code `+1' (spaces are allowed)./

     If everthing works fine, you should see:

           Logged in!

  4. Start up tg-focus daemon:

     ┌────
     │ ./tgfocus quickstart
     └────

     /note: conversely, use `./tgfocus shutdown' to shutdown tg-focus/

     If everthing works fine, you should see:

           startup: done

           focus-start: done

  5. Go back to your Telgram application, wait for the TG-FOCUS group
     showing up. /(usually takes up 1~2 mins, depends on your network
     connection)/

           If TG-FOCUS group doesn't appear, send a message
           "tg-focus" in a random group(e.g. Saved
           Messages). /This is because by default, only messages
           contain "tg-focus" will be filtered and forwarded./

           If TG-FOCUS group doesn't appear after a long
           wait(e.g. 10 mins), run a command `./tgfocus status',
           report and open a GitHub issue with the command output
           attached.

  6. Once the group shown up, you send a message `TGFCMD help' to get
     started. Check [TGFCMD] for more details.

Using TGFCMD
────────────

  Say there is a Telegram user, called Bob. He owns a group. Every day,
  plenty of messages are sending out in that group, it is too
  overwhelming, Bob wants to focus on the messages that strongly
  interest him, he decides to use tg-focus. After the previous 6-step
  setup, he now is going to use TGFCMD to configure his tg-focus to
  forward the messages he is strongly interested in:

TGFCMD Examples
═══════════════

  /Note that TGFCMD commands are to be sent out in the TG-FOCUS group/

  To forward the messages that belong to the chat "Freedom User Group":

  ┌────
  │ TGFCMD filter.edit 1 titles add "Freedom User Group"
  └────

  To forward the messages that sent by the user "Some One":

  ┌────
  │ TGFCMD filter.edit 1 senders add "Some One"
  └────

  To forward the messages that contain a word "freedom":

  ┌────
  │ TGFCMD filter.edit 1 keywords add "freedom"  
  └────

  To forward two types of messages, the first contains a word "free
  things" and belongs to the chat "Nonfree Lovers", the second contains
  a word "nonfree things" and belongs to "Free Lovers":

  ┌────
  │ TGFCMD filter.edit 1 titles add "Nonfree Lovers"
  │ TGFCMD filter.edit 1 keywords add "free things"
  │ TGFCMD filter.edit 2 titles add "Free Lovers"
  │ TGFCMD filter.edit 2 keywords add "nonfree things"
  └────

  Not to forward the messages that sent by the user "Nonfree Lover":

  ┌────
  │ TGFCMD filter.edit 1 no-senders add "Nonfree Lover"
  └────

  Check current filters configuration:

  ┌────
  │ TGFCMD filters
  └────

  Pause forwarding:

  ┌────
  │ TGFCMD pause
  └────

  Resume forwarding:

  ┌────
  │ TGFCMD resume
  └────


Filters Rules
═════════════

  Filters configurationa is composed of many /Focus Filters/. A /Focus
  Filter/ is a filter to match against the message's
  chat/sender/content. They have several rules(or properties):

  • /titles/
  • /keywords/
  • /senders/
  • /no-titles/
  • /no-senders/
  • /no-keywords/

  Simply put, /titles/, /keywords/, /senders/ are the lists of chat
  titles, keywords, senders that you are interested in respectively.
  /no-titles/, /no-keywords/, /no-senders/ are the ones you don't want
  to see.

  Users can add values to those rules as many as they like, they accept
  **simple text** or **regular expression**, as well as filters.

  When a message comes, filters are tried one by one, if there is any
  filter than can *match* the message and not *reject* it, it will be
  forwarded to TG-FOCUS chat.

  A focus filter *matches* the message if it matches any filter's:

  • /titles/ and
  • /senders/ and
  • /keywords/

  Note that an empty rule(i.e., you haven't configure it) matches
  everthing.

  If a focus filter fails to match the incoming message, the next focus
  filter will be tried. If all focus filters fail to match it, the
  message will be discarded.

  A focus filter *rejects* the message if it matches any filter's:

  • /no-title/ or
  • /no senders/ or
  • /no-keywords/

  Note thta if any focus filter rejects the message, the next focus
  filter will not be tried, and the message will be discarded.

  (You can think of the first three rules as /whitelist/, the last three
  rules as /blacklist/)

FAQ
═══

Why yet another Telegram message forwarder?
───────────────────────────────────────────

  There are already many TG message forwarders over there, and some of
  them have been continuously developed for a long time. I do think most
  of them are doing a great job. However what I was looking for was a
  message forwarder with a combination of stability, reliability,
  transparency, and flexibility, none of them could completely meet my
  personal preference, at least in the days before this project started.


Can I trust tg-focus?
─────────────────────

  Yes.

  First of all, consider that tg-focus is a GPL-licensed [free
  software](<https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html>). As for
  privacy, only credentials necessary for tdlib initialization are saved
  on the user's machine. And they are completely /yours-irrelavent/. As
  for source code, tg-focus's source as well as its dependencies' source
  are completely open.

  And one more step we take is that, all of released binaries are built
  by *not* any individual, but *Github-hosted* machines.  Check [github
  actions] for more details.
