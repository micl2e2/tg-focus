Overview
════════

  tg-focus is a comprehensive Telegram message filter that helps you
  *focus*. A gentle user bot for message forwarding. Most of message
  types are supported: public/private chats, channel updates, and more.

  By customizing /focus filters/, tg-focus can forward any specific
  message from any chat to a dedicated chat, *TG-FOCUS*, that way you
  have full control of the messages you see.

  tg-focus is built on top of [TDLib], and speaks the same language as
  TDLib speaks, in which way tg-focus is just inherently as consistent,
  reliable and stable as TDLib itself for most Telegram-specific
  functionalities.

  The supported platforms are:

Quickstart
══════════

  The following 7 steps will help you start up tg-focus and filter some
  specific messages.

  1. Download the binaries at GitHub releases [page].

  2. Extract the files:

     ┌────
     │ # linux 
     │ tar xf tg-focus-XXX-linux-gnu-x86_64.tgz
     │ cd tg-focus-XXX-linux-gnu-x86_64
     └────

  3. Log in your Telegram account firstly, it needs your phone number
     and a login code. Phone number should be typed in international
     format, e.g., `+1 23 4567' if your phone number is `23 4567' with
     region code `+1'.

     ┌────
     │ ./tgfocus auth
     │ 
     │ # enter your phone and login code...
     └────

     If everthing works fine, you should see:

     ┌────
     │ Logged in successfullly! 
     └────

  4. Start up tg-focus daemon:

     ┌────
     │ ./tgfocus quickstart
     └────

     If everthing works fine, you should see:

     ┌────
     │ startup: done
     │ focus-start: done
     └────

  5. Go back to your Telgram application, open the TG-FOCUS chat.

     /(NOTE) since the default filter does not filter any messages, you
     might see many continuously incoming messages./

  6. Configure the focus filters. Suppose you only want to see the
     messages where the word "freedom" is mentioned, you add it to the
     keyword list by sending this message to the TG-FOCUS chat:

     ┌────
     │ TGFCMD editf 1 keywords add "freedom"
     └────

     /(NOTE) don't forget two double quotes./

     If everthing works fine, you should see:

     ┌────
     │ [ TGFCMD ] success
     └────

     You can also check your focus filters by sending this message:

     ┌────
     │ TGFCMD filters
     └────

  7. Then wait patiently at TG-FOCUS, and enjoy your every
     freedom-related conversion :-)

TGFCMD Examples
═══════════════

  /Note that all of command mentioned in this section are to be sent out
  at TG-FOCUS chat/


  To forward the messages that belong to the chat "Freedom User Group":

  ┌────
  │ TGFCMD editf 1 titles add "Freedom User Group"
  └────

  To forward the messages that sent by the user "Some One":

  ┌────
  │ TGFCMD editf 1 senders add "Some One"
  └────

  To forward the messages that contain a word "freedom":

  ┌────
  │ TGFCMD editf 1 keywords add "freedom"  
  └────

  To forward two types of messages, the first contains a word "free
  things" and belongs to the chat "Nonfree Lovers", the second contains
  a word "nonfree things" and belongs to "Free Lovers":

  ┌────
  │ TGFCMD editf 1 titles add "Nonfree Lovers"
  │ TGFCMD editf 1 keywords add "free things"
  │ TGFCMD editf 2 titles add "Free Lovers"
  │ TGFCMD editf 2 keywords add "nonfree things"
  └────

  Not to forward the messages that sent by the user "Nonfree Lover":

  ┌────
  │ TGFCMD editf 1 no-senders add "Nonfree Lover"
  └────

  Check current filters configuration:

  ┌────
  │ TGFCMD filters
  └────

  Pause forwarding:

  ┌────
  │ TGFCMD pause
  └────

  Resume forwarding:

  ┌────
  │ TGFCMD resume
  └────


Filters Rules
═════════════

  Filters configurationa is composed of many /Focus Filters/. A /Focus
  Filter/ is a filter to match against the message's
  chat/sender/content. They have several rules(or properties):

  • /titles/
  • /keywords/
  • /senders/
  • /no-titles/
  • /no-senders/
  • /no-keywords/

  Simply put, /titles/, /keywords/, /senders/ are the lists of chat
  titles, keywords, senders that you are interested in respectively.
  /no-titles/, /no-keywords/, /no-senders/ are the ones you don't want
  to see.

  Users can add values to those rules as many as they like, they accept
  **simple text** or **regular expression**, as well as filters.

  When a message comes, filters are tried one by one, if there is any
  filter than can *match* the message and not *reject* it, it will be
  forwarded to TG-FOCUS chat.

  A focus filter *matches* the message if it matches any filter's:

  • /titles/ and
  • /senders/ and
  • /keywords/

  Note that an empty rule(i.e., you haven't configure it) matches
  everthing.

  If a focus filter fails to match the incoming message, the next focus
  filter will be tried. If all focus filters fail to match it, the
  message will be discarded.

  A focus filter *rejects* the message if it matches any filter's:

  • /no-title/ or
  • /no senders/ or
  • /no-keywords/

  Note thta if any focus filter rejects the message, the next focus
  filter will not be tried, and the message will be discarded.

  (You can think of the first three rules as /whitelist/, the last three
  rules as /blacklist/)


Development
═══════════

  • ☐ BSD Port


Can I trust tg-focus?
═════════════════════

  Yes.

  First of all, consider that tg-focus is a GPL-licensed [free
  software](<https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html>). As for
  privacy, only credentials necessary for tdlib initialization are saved
  on the user's machine. And they are completely /yours-irrelavent/. As
  for source code, tg-focus's source as well as its dependencies' source
  are completely open.

  Most importantly, all of released binaries are built by *not* any
  individual, *but* Github-hosted machines. Check [github actions] for
  more details.

Is tg-focus a crawler?
══════════════════════

  Despite tg-focus is essentially collecting messsages, tg-focus is not,
  and will never be a crawler: forwarded messages is designed to be
  difficult to parse, and the forwarding is hardly real-time. If you use
  it as a crawler, you will realize this is a wrong tool over the course
  of time.

  I am here to help telegram users see or omit the messages according to
  their own preferences. Using tg-focus to crawl messages would be
  absolutely a misuse. And also we will ensure such usages to become
  more and more challenging in future releases, because my *primary
  goal* is to help catalyze more constructive and meaningful conversions
  on Telegram.

  Check if tg-focus is for you or not:


It's for you if
───────────────

  1. You think messages are overwhelming, and still don't want to miss
     out any messages/updates that match your personal preference.

  2. Your think some kinds of messages do not match your personal
     preference and want to ignore them, yet they have reason to exist.


It's NOT for you if
───────────────────

  1. You want to scrape/crawl messages from chats/channels.
