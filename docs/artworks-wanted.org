* Artworks Wanted

Hello everyone! üëã tg-focus's appearance now needs to be more
distinguishable. So I am looking for some beautiful artworks to
enhance the project‚Äôs appearance.

** What I Need 

/Icon/Logo/: I‚Äôm *specifically* looking for an icon or logo that
represents the essence of tg-focus. And it will be used as default
avatar for /TG-FOCUS/ group. It should be memorable, simple, and
reflect the main goal of the project: *focus*.

/Configuration Demonstrations/: Apart from the icon, I‚Äôd like series of
screenshots that capture the steps of process configuring tg-focus to
get it worked, just like the ones already emebbed in README's "A Simple Demo"
section, which are demonstrations in English.
I need **more other languages** (no more than 15 pics per language). 

** How You Can Contribute
